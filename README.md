# E-Waste Generation Classification - Week 1

## ðŸ”¹ Objective
Begin the E-Waste Generation Classification project by setting up the environment, understanding the dataset, and performing initial data exploration and preprocessing.

## ðŸ”¹ Work Done
- Downloaded and understood the dataset related to E-Waste generation.
- Loaded the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Displayed data types and summary statistics.
  - Checked for missing values and class distribution.
- Preprocessed data by:
  - Removing or filling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Visualized class distribution to understand imbalance (if any).

## ðŸ”¹ Outcome
The data is now clean and ready for feature selection and model training in Week 2.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
